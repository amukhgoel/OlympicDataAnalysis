# OlympicDataAnalysis

Work on Tokyo Olympics 2021 data to perform the Data Engineering Tasks using Microsoft Azure i.e, Creating the ETL pipleline to load the raw data from the Github repository and then load it in the Azure Data Lake. Then creating the tables using the tranformed data loaded into the transformed layer of Azure Data Lake Gen 2 using Data Factory. Using Azure Synapse Analytics to query the data from the tables and perform the analytics required on the data.

Main goal is to perform the ETL tasks on Azure using the features like Azure Data Lake Gen2, Azure Synapse, Azure Data Factory, Azure SQL, PowerBI for visualizing the data.

Tasks Involved:
  1.  Employing ADF to bring data to the Raw Layer of ADLS(Azure Data Lake Storage).
  2.  Using Databricks to transform and refine the data to ADLS Transformed layer.
  3.  Then using Azure Synapse Analytics for Data Warehousing and detailed Analytics
      of the data allowing deep exploration and insights.
  4.  Finally use Power-BI to visualize the data insights.
